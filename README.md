scheduler for the raspberry pi GPIO pins

This project aims to give a user an easy way to schedule start and stop of the Raspbherry Pi's GPIO pins.

It will have a DB, API and multiple frontends when complete.

I currently use it for my sprinklers but with the correct relay board it can be used to power anything on a schedule.
